## Topics of Australian Marine Scince Projects with data from Australia's Integrated Marine Observation System (IMOS)

This repository showcases labs and projects completed during the course, Topics of Australian Marine Science, taken at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS) from February-May 2024. Labs explore data used by facilities part of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) such as Animal Tracking, Autonomous UnderWater Vehicles, Argo Floats, and National Mooring Network in addition to data from the IMOS Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey and National Reference Stations (NRS) program. 

# Animal Tracking

This project utilised data from the Australian Acoustic Telemetry Database, focusing on the detection of bullsharks around New South Wales, Australia. I investigated spatial and temporal trends of bullshark movement inside of Sydney Harbour, seasonal variation of detections along Australia's east coast, and possible intra-individual variation.
